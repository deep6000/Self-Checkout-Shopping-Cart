Project completed under Prof. Timothy Scherr and Prof. Randall Spalding in the course Low Power Embedded Design Techniques, University of Colorado, Boulder.

Every project update would be updated on a different branch to go back at any point of time. Switch branches to see weekly updates to the project. Every subsequent update would build on the previous branch finally leading to a branch which would consist of the entire final project.
